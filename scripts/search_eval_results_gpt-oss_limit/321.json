    "text": "Yes, I will sign under each word. You just read our career framework right now. It's just one-on-one. It's everywhere, you know. I had the same thing in Basfit. They are super abstract. The current company is even more abstract. It's very short. We have four criteria for engineers. These are technologies. Next, execution. Next, communication and leadership. They are written for each level on a page. But very abstract. I read and it's hard for me to understand and explain where someone is and why someone is not ready to be trained. It's hard for me to read engineers. It's hard for me to train myself. So, it's a problem. Plus, it's one level of problem. The second level of problem is a global issue with career frameworks. I have a personal complaint. Let's be honest. When we talk about a career, it's a rock. It's a rock from engineer to manager. If you want a career, go to management. If you want professional growth, it's a rock in higher-level IC. I think it's a very... It's a change of concept when engineers say, yes, you can develop career-wise. We have a career framework. You can become a staff engineer, a principal engineer. But it's not about a career. It's about professional growth. It's a bit different. Because I see that the CTO has a much greater impact and influence on the company than the principal engineer. Let's take the director of engineers and the staff engineer or principal engineer, how do you think about it? I see that the director has a much greater influence on the whole organization than the principal engineer. I think it's very offensive to see that career... When people talk about a career, they are actually... I'll paraphrase it. You can grow professionally, but career growth is about something else. I want to argue with you. Because a career is not only about how many people can reach it, it's also about a banal thing like money. Usually career growth is accompanied by money, the amount of money in your pocket. I would also like to note the status. Yes, the status. We joked a bit in the last days. We joked a lot before, in the last issue, that you need to become a manager after. It's a bit of a shame. Being a staff engineer is a bit less of a shame than being a midlaner. In this regard, it's still career growth. Even if you switch between companies, even if the statuses never match, you will hardly go from the staff engineer or some distinguished fellow to a regular senior commidor. Most likely, you will have an interesting status and comparable salary. If you are stuck on the position of a senior, you need to prove that you were a special senior and you just didn't want to be a manager. So, career growth can also be considered. The impact is different, but not everyone is important. You can be a manager, but you can be a manager. It will be professional growth. You become more efficient, you know more, you grow as an engineer, and your professional growth brings you to the staff. What is the difference between career growth and professional growth? You don't scale globally. This is the main problem in professional growth. You have some interesting example of career growth. Let me explain how I see it. When you grow as an individual contributor, you have a thing that doesn't scale your time. No matter how hard you try, you still have 8 hours a day for your work. You can't physically spend more time on this work to do more. When you work as a manager, your time is scaled. You can scale yourself through management of more and more teams. In engineering, there is no such thing in IC track. You still have a physical limit. You can be super efficient, you can keep more and more structures in your head. You can do frameworks, do large infrastructure projects. But if you reach the level of an architect, you stop coding. If you want to keep such a big structure in your head, you stop coding. As a result, you will stop being an individual contributor. IC is not scaled. It is tied to your physical capabilities, to your hours. We got your point. I think it exists only in your head. I looked at a few words. Any promotion. You are a manager, you move more, you have less impact. The way your work develops, some activities, life, some stages of development, it will be called a career. You are a manager, you move more, you have less impact. I don't understand why. There is no connection to the obligatory impact. You can develop in your career and not increase your impact in terms of the number of hours and the number of influence. You can become a very high-class specialist in a very narrow area and your impact will not increase. You will not be able to influence millions of people. You will have a different status. You will be a great specialist. I understand that you want to say Sveta, but she calls it strange. Why is it one career and another one not a career? I understand why. For Sveta, it is important for her. I understand her point of view. I have many acquaintances who share this point of view. Можно я со стороны вклюнусь? Все, о чем вы говорили, во многом про мотивацию. Я услышала, что Sveta мотивирует идея масштабироваться и чтобы было больше возможностей решать крупные задачи. У кого-то мотивация может зарабатывать. Она не единственная должна быть, но бывает и такая. Я хочу привести очень классную ссылочку. Я ее добавлю в show notes. Я недавно наткнулся. Есть сайт, называется levels.fi. Я даже не знал, что такой домен существует. По этой ссылке сравниваются с сайтом, который я нашел. Я не знаю, что это такое. Я не знаю, что это такое. Это сравнивается с лестницей карьерной для софтовой инжинир. В разных компаниях. Я добавил Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook и Microsoft. У них очень интересно посмотреть, что может очень сильно отличаться понятие. Я смотрю на Microsoft и Amazon. Принципл в Microsoft ниже. Они не пересекаются с принциплом в Amazon. Это тоже надо учитывать, когда вы называете себя кем-то. Кто-то по линейке Microsoft, кто-то по Apple. Это тоже любопытная вещь. Мы недавно обсуждали, на каком уровне равняется кому, на каком уровне в другой компании.",
